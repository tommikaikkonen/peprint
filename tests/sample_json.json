In particular, he has contributed to the theory behind functional programming[8] and the use of monads in functional programming, the design of the purely functional language Haskell,[9] and the XQuery declarative query language. In 1984, he created the Orwell programming language. Wadler was involved in adding generic types to Java 5.0.[10] He is also author of the paper Theorems for free![11] that gave rise to much research on functional language optimization (see also Parametricity). p"
